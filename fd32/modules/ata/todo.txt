o The time stuff and the power stuff is unfinished, especially the "delay"
  function, witch should probably be more like the Linux delay function
  and placed in the kernel.
  
o What about interface.h. Have I done it right.
  Does it matter what number are used? Does it matter what names are used.
  Should it be placed there at all?

o What syntax would be best for device specific options? "--hda-block-mode
  16"? And what about options specific to an interface. "--interface-2-irq
  12"? Doesn't seem right. How does the user know what "interface 2" is? A
  table in the documentation? And what device names should be used for
  CD-ROM drives?

o There is still some ATA2 commands not implemented:
	READ/WRITE LONG				obsolete
	FORMAT TRACK				obsolete
	SEEK					obsolete
	RECALIBRATE				obsolete
	DOOR LOCK/UNLOCK			todo?
	ACKN. MEDIA CHANGE			todo?
	MEDIA EJECT				todo?
	BOOT					???
	EXECUTE DEV. DIAGNOSTIC			todo
	INIT. DEV. PARAM.			obsolete?
	READ/WRITE DMA				don't bother with
						multiword etc, go for UDMA
	READ/WRITE VERIFY			???
	READ/WRITE BUFFER			???
	SLEEP					done
	WRITE SAME				useful for formatting?
	NOP					probably not
	DOWNLOAD MICROCODE			todo :-)

o Implement overlapping.

o Improve handling of DRDY.

o Find out if the system has a PCI bus (and use it).

o Implement "DEVICE RESET".
