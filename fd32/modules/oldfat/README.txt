by Salvo Isaja

A driver that allows to use the FAT file system, the standard
one for DOS and Windows machines, under FD32. The most important
features of the FAT Driver are: FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 support,
file length up to 4 GiB, Long File Names, buffered I/O,
integrated sharing support, name cache for fast open.

HOW TO COMPILE FOR FREEDOS 32
Use the makefile "Makefile".
From the command line, use "make" to generate the "fat.o" object
file to be used as FD32 driver.
At present it has to be loaded after disk drivers.

HOW TO COMPILE FOR THE DOS TARGET
Use the makefile "Makefile.dj".
Use "make -f Makefile.dj" to generate the "fat.o" object file
targetted for the DJGPP libraries.

DEPENDENCES
- unicode.o
- devices.o
- cp437.o
The fat.o driver uses the Devices Engine (devices.o) for devices
management, the Unicode Support Library (unicode.o) and the local
code page support (only cp437.o at present) to deal with file
name strings.
- filesys.o
Load the FAT Driver after the File System Layer (filesys.o) in
order to let it know that a new file system driver is available
to mount file systems on its drives. The FAT Driver also uses the
file name management services of the FS Layer.
